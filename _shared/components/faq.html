        <button class="faq-q">What is an AI agent and how can it help my business?<span class="faq-arrow">▾</span></button>
        <div class="faq-a"><div class="faq-a-inner">An AI agent is an autonomous software system that can perform complex tasks without constant human supervision. Unlike simple automations that follow fixed rules, AI agents can research, analyze data, make decisions, and take actions across multiple tools. For example, an AI agent can qualify leads, respond to customer inquiries, generate reports, and update your CRM — all without human intervention, 24 hours a day.</div></div>
