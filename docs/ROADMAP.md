# Roadmap — GrowwStacks Landing Pages

_Last updated: 2026-09-11_

Current state of the site and the prioritized list of what's next. Update this every
session: move finished items into [`DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md`](DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md) and
re-rank what remains.

---

## Current state (snapshot)

- **Homepage hero** — ✅ on the refined Claude design (`.gs-hero-ds`, scoped). Live.
- **Credentials strip** (`partners.html`) — ✅ on the refined design (`.gs-creds-ds`). Live.
- **CTA copy** — ✅ "Book a Free Automation Audit" across the hero consult fold and
  the global nav button. Live.
- **Everything else** (what-we-do, process, stats, cases, industries, testimonials,
  footer, all blog/landing pages) — still on the **original** design system in
  `global.css`. Unchanged.
- **Lead form / Make.com webhook** — untouched and working (WebMCP attrs added are
  additive only; no field names changed).
- **Floating widgets** (projects ticker + chat) — ✅ now load on page-load, not on
  scroll-to-footer. Unpushed.
- **Structured data (JSON-LD)** - ✅ repaired site-wide on 2026-09-11: 2,132 files fixed,
  **38,642 / 38,720 blocks (99.8%) now valid**. 66 pages remain broken and need manual
  review (`docs/JSONLD_REMAINING.txt`). Unpushed.
- **Agentic browsing / WebMCP** — `llms.txt` added (→ Lighthouse 3/3); declarative +
  imperative WebMCP tools added (`_shared/webmcp.js`). ⏸️ Origin-trial token pending.

The site is in a **mixed-design state**: homepage first fold + credentials use the
refined system; the rest uses the original. This is intentional and stable.

## Next actions (prioritized)

### P0 — In flight (this session, unpushed)
- [ ] **Structured data - Search Console "Validate Fix".** Once the JSON-LD repair is
      deployed, open both issues ("Missing '}' or object member name" and "Missing
      ',' or '}'") in GSC and click **Validate Fix**. All 11 originally-flagged URLs
      now parse locally - see DEVELOPMENT_LOG 2026-09-11.
- [ ] **Review the 66 pages still carrying invalid JSON-LD** (`docs/JSONLD_REMAINING.txt`).
      These have compound damage (deleted keys, unclosed `<script>` tags) that could not be
      repaired mechanically without inventing schema values. Mostly `blog/` (53).
- [ ] **Claude Architect page — visual QA at 1440 / 768 / 390 px.** The page was
      rebuilt onto the user-supplied "Enlight Lab" layout (coral-recoloured, scoped
      under `.cc-page`) — see DEVELOPMENT_LOG 2026-08-13. Markup, JSON-LD and the
      case-study script hooks are verified, but it has **not been opened in a
      browser**. Highest-risk area: the `.orb-wrap` satellite labels (`.d1`–`.d4`)
      are absolutely positioned and may crowd on narrow screens.
- [ ] **Multi-Channel AI Telemedicine Agents case study — review the two chat
      screenshots for identifying brand marks before publish.** `01_Chat_Agent_Greeting`
      and `02_Chat_Agent_Answer` show the client's own chat widget; prose, alt text,
      captions and schema are clean and the client is never named, but the widget
      chrome may carry the practice's brand name or colour. Confirm visually, blur if
      so. (The workflow and hero images are generic.)
- [ ] **Tuition Management Portal case study — blur the screenshots before publish.**
      `02_Schedule_Management_Calendar.png` shows an unblurred tutor name in "Available
      Slots", and `01`, `03`, `04` show unblurred revenue / tutor-pay / parent-bill
      figures. Page prose, alt text, captions, and schema are already clean; only the
      images carry identifying data. (Sidebar duration resolved to 7 weeks — no TODO
      markers remain on the page.)
- [ ] **Register the WebMCP origin trial** for `growwstacks.com` (Chrome Origin
      Trials console) and paste the token into `_headers` (uncomment the two
      placeholder lines). Without it, the WebMCP tools stay inactive in production.
- [ ] **After deploy, re-run Lighthouse** agentic category: confirm llms.txt passes
      (3/3) and, once the token is live, that WebMCP tools are captured.
- [ ] **Smoke-test widget timing**: on a hard reload, the projects ticker + chat
      widget should appear within ~2s of load *without scrolling*.

### P1 — Likely next
- [ ] **Finance / Healthcare / Operations "problem strip"** (design section 2).
      Not built yet. Agreed placement: **a new inline section in `index.html`
      directly below the hero** (second fold). Build with the scoped-CSS pattern
      (`.gs-problem-ds` or similar). Copy from the design: loan re-keying / missed
      clinic calls / off-the-shelf AI that doesn't fit ops.

### P2 — Small polish
- [ ] **Form submit button copy** → optionally "Book a Free Automation Audit →" to
      match the new CTA wording (currently "Get My Free Automation Audit →").
      Text-only change; no webhook impact. Confirm with Manish first (it's on the
      "form side" he asked to leave alone).
- [ ] **Commit the Claude design bundle** under `docs/design-system/` (or a
      reference link) so future sessions have the source of truth for the refined
      system without re-fetching the export.

### P3 — Bigger decisions (need Manish's call before starting)
- [ ] **Full design migration.** Decide whether to roll the refined Claude design
      across the whole site (what-we-do, process, cases, industries, testimonials,
      footer, blog/landing templates). This is a large, site-wide effort and would
      likely mean evolving `global.css` itself — big blast radius (~13k pages).
      Until decided, keep using **per-section scoped blocks**.
- [ ] **Nav button length.** "Book a Free Automation Audit →" is longer than the old
      label; it fits on desktop and is hidden < 1024px, but watch for awkwardness on
      mid-width desktops. Revisit if it looks tight.

---

## Open decisions / questions

- **Public exposure of `docs/` and `CLAUDE.md`.** Because Cloudflare Pages serves the
  repo as-is with no build step, these files are reachable at
  `growwstacks.com/CLAUDE.md`, `/docs/…`. They contain internal notes (not secrets —
  the webhook URL is already public in `site-config.js`). Options: (a) keep local /
  don't push, (b) push but block via `robots.txt` + a `_redirects` 404 rule, or
  (c) push as-is. **Pending Manish's preference** — see DEVELOPMENT_LOG entry.
- **Design source of truth.** The refined design currently lives only in the external
  Claude Design export. Committing a copy (P2) removes that dependency.

---

## Known issues (low priority)

- Pre-existing **unmatched `</div>`** near the `#consultation` wrapper in
  `index.html`. Browsers tolerate it; fix only if doing a broader cleanup of that file.
- `global.css` still carries styles for components that may have been superseded by
  scoped blocks (e.g. legacy `.partners`/`.partner-badge`). Dead but harmless; prune
  only as part of a deliberate cleanup pass.
- **Broken-but-tolerated case-study includes.** `_shared/case-studies.css` is referenced
  by 311 case-study pages but **does not exist in the repo**; all `cs-*` styles actually
  live in `global.css`. Likewise `../case-studies.js` resolves one level above the file's
  real location (`case-studies/case-studies.js`), and the FAQ/video handlers it provides
  are also bound by `page-builder.js`. Both requests return 200 in production, so nothing
  is visibly broken — new pages replicate the includes for consistency. Worth one
  deliberate pass to either add the file or strip the references site-wide.

## Done (recent — see DEVELOPMENT_LOG for detail)

- 2026-07-30 — New case study: Multi-Channel AI Telemedicine Agents (page + hub card
  #55). Card kept to the strict 1:1 badge↔category rule (`healthcare`) rather than the
  brief's three tokens; filters still sum to 57 = 57. Unpushed — see P0 for the
  screenshot-blur check and the pending walkthrough video.
- 2026-06-22 — Widget load-on-page-load fix, `llms.txt`, WebMCP declarative +
  imperative tools, origin-trial scaffold (unpushed — pending review + token).
- 2026-06-08 — Hero redesign, credentials strip, CTA copy alignment (`3d0af1c8`, live).
- 2026-06-08 — Project documentation set established.
